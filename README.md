# Case-Book-Review-Analysis-and-Prediction-Model

---

## Project Purpose

This project aims to analyze book reviews by performing sentiment analysis on review texts and predicting their corresponding ratings. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models to process book review datasets. By doing so, it enables the identification of whether user comments are positive, negative, or neutral, as well as the prediction of review ratings. The project is particularly applicable in areas such as the publishing industry, e-commerce platforms, and book recommendation systems.

## General Structure

The project is designed with a modular structure and consists of the following core components:

- **Data Reading and Preprocessing**: Reads JSON-formatted datasets, processing review texts and related metadata (e.g., ratings, summaries, helpful votes). Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and prepared for deep learning models.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes visualization tools to understand trends and distributions within the dataset. For example, rating distributions or review lengths are analyzed using graphical representations.
- **Model Development**: Employs NLP and deep learning techniques to develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis and predicting ratings from review texts. This model incorporates deep learning layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

The project serves as a starting point for researchers and developers working with text data and building predictive models.
